<h1>Descriptor Research</h1>

This material is intended to accompany the paper "Research of descriptor based image normalization and comparative analysis of SURF, SIFT, BRISK, ORB, KAZE, AKAZE DESCRIPTORS". The full version can be found at the link [].
It contains the own dataset with 100 image pairs, the normalized images, their overlaps, the tables with different estimations, the summary diagrams.

This work is dedicated to:
* research of the parametric normalization approach, where key points and their descriptors are used to find out the normalization parameters;
* comparing the quality and time costs of the normalization process based on different descriptors. For comparison were selected the full-cycle descriptors, such as SURF128, SURF64, SIFT, BRISK, ORB, ORB1000, KAZE, AKAZE.
